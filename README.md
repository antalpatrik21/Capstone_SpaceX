### This is a project for IBM Data Science Capstone. Using SpaceX data predict the landing outcome of Falcon 9. 

#### Have you ever woke up feeling like competing with Elon Musk? If yes, you are in a great repository for starting your own commercial space flight company SpaceW (of course W stands for winning). By joining me throughout the journey to analyse publicly available launch data you will be equipped with a machine learning model that can predict the landing outcome of a newly launched rocked based on the specificities of the flight, with an astonishing 1.0 accuracy. 

#### Open the pdf file with a presentation and follow the steps inclouded. 

#### It is a small step for a man, but as always a giant leap for mankind.
